<g:title>USA Flag NeoDanna</g:title>
<g:description>USA Flag NeoDanna, awesome! We';re hoping these things take the world by storm, quickly becoming the Biker Mask for every schmuck with a motorcycle. And not just because we';re selling them, although it';s always nice to have a little more green stuff in our coffers. (Our accountant is always asking us why we keep so much pesto in the coffers. We';re like: Dude, if you have to ask, you';ll never understand. Bean-counters!)  No, the main reason we want everyone on planet Earth using an USA Flag NeoDanna is that it';ll lead to more incidents of unintentional patriotism.  Let';s face it, it';s not going to happen OFTEN. The circumstances would have to be just right. Plus, The Neodanna is a revolutionary item with multiple features. Our 100% cotton bandanna is combined with a USA Flag neoprene facemask to ensure full coverage of the face and neck, providing a comfortable light-weight fit. The neoprene section covers the cheeks, nose &amp;amp; mouth, while the bandanna is easily adjusted with a Velcro closure. Ideal for wind and dust protection in both warm and cold weather settings.  But come on. There are billions of people in the world, and a lot of them ride motorcycles. Think how many of them must be cold. Now think how many USA Flag NeoDannas there are. Now think how many possibilities that presents for the planets and the stars to align just right every once in a while and for the public to get its eyeballs on a patriotic USA Flag NeoDanna.</g:description>

Ideal for snow sports, the cushiony featherweight material is weather tested and engineered to keep the harmful elements of cold weather at bayalt="motorcycle-rider-masks.gif" width="272" height="250" /&amp;gt;Introducing what could possibly be the easiest way to convince a toddler you have magic powers.  When looking at this Ancient Skull Neoprene Face Mask, it's natural to consider the warmth you will enjoy and the dryness it will provide, but really, in only considering those aspects, you're missing out on the best part.  What's that best part, you ask? Well, it's simple: fooling our children or nieces and nephews into thinking we turned into aliens.  It doesn't take much. All you need to do is call them over, put the Ancient Skull Neoprene Face Mask on, and then just keep your mouth shut and don't say a word.  Then, when the kid starts shouting "I wanna try! I wanna try!" you quickly Velcro it off yourself and Velcro it onto them. They'll try to repeat your "silent" success, but it won't work....They can never be quiet! Their eyes will widen, and they'll acknowledge that, yes, indeed you are a Alien.  That, or they'll punch the screen out of frustration or spit up on the keyboard, but that's up to you to stop that from happening. We can only do so much.</g:description>

<g:title>Woodland Camouflage NeoDanna</g:title>
<g:description>Pretty much everyone at this point knows and accepts that the internet is a Geiger-esque wasteland of fetishes, conspiracy theories, and Crockpot recipes. For every research site, every safe chat room for kids to hang out, and every scanned painting of Picasso's there are probably 40,000 sites dedicated to someone pooping on it.  So it's a rare moment in this day and age to stumble across something on the internet that is truly useful.  The Woodland Camouflage NeoDanna is truly a bright spot for the internet.  The Camouflage Neodanna is a revolutionary item with multiple features. Our 100% cotton bandanna is combined with a Woodland Camo Neoprene Facemask to ensure full coverage of the face and neck, providing a comfortable light-weight fit. The neoprene section covers the cheeks, nose &amp;amp; mouth, while the bandanna is easily adjusted with a Velcro? closure. Ideal for wind and dust protection in both warm and cold weather settings.  So close the door or something, because people will be shocked to see you doing something useful on the internet.</g:description>

<g:title>Digital ACU NeoDanna</g:title>
<g:description>HOST: Welcome to The Answer Is Kim Jong-Il, the only game show in the entire world. Today';s first combatant is Paek Song-Ryol, a street-sweeper from Kaesong Industrial Region who enjoys chess, ideology, and foraging for edible grasses. Comrade Paek, our informants indicate that you have not smiled since Juche year 71, or the imperialist year 1989. The Great Leader Kim Jong-Il salutes you on your serious-mindedness.  PAEK SONG-RYOL (bowing, nodding): Thank you, Great Leader. Thank you.  HOST: Your enemy today is Tammy McDougal, a claims adjuster from Ventura, California, who has cravenly wasted her life in service to the imperialists. How many Korean babies have you starved to death today, Ms. McDougal?  TAMMY MCDOUGAL: Uh, excuse me?  HOST: Never mind. Your crimes are infamous to all the peoples of the world, and you shall be judged severely for your deviations. Now, let';s play our game. Question the first: who is the only NBA player to score 100 points in a single game?  TAMMY MCDOUGAL: Wilt Chamberlain.  HOST: Incorrect!  PAEK SONG-RYOL (bowing, nodding): Kim Jong-Il, please.  HOST: Correct! The answer is Kim Jong-Il! Comrade Paek, you win 100 grains of rice. Question the second: who invented the world';s first artificial human heart?  TAMMY MCDOUGAL: That was Robert Jarvik.  HOST: Incorrect!  PAEK SONG-RYOL (bowing, nodding): Kim Jong-Il, please.  HOST: Correct! The answer is Kim Jong-Il! Comrade Paek, you win 200 grains of rice. Question the third: what company makes the Digital ACU NeoDanna that features a revolutionary item with multiple features. Our 100% cotton bandanna is combined with a neoprene face mask to ensure full coverage of the face and neck, providing a comfortable light-weight fit. The neoprene section covers the cheeks, nose &amp;amp; mouth, while the bandanna is easily adjusted with a Velcro closure. Ideal for wind and dust protection in both warm and cold weather settings. Digital Green Camouflage. U.S.A. Patented, all in a package that';s affordable for the typical worker?  TAMMY MCDOUGAL: OK, now I know this one for sure. It';s Iron Horse Helmets.  HOST: Incorrect!  PAEK SONG-RYOL (bowing, nodding): Kim Jong-Il, please.  HOST: Correct! The answer is Kim Jong-Il! Comrade Paek, you win 300 grains of rice.  TAMMY MCDOUGAL: But that doesn';t make any sense! Kim Jong-Il is a person, not a company-  HOST: Silence! Guards, take away this counterrevolutionary contestant and strap her into the chair for the &amp;ldquo;lightning round." That';s all we have time for today. Until next time, we raise a revolutionary salute to Comrade Paek Song-Ryol, who remembered the most important piece of trivia of them all: The Answer Is Kim Jong-Il!</g:description>

<g:title>Pink Flames Neodanna</g:title>
<g:description>I';m telling you that I';m going to be at Daytona Bike Week this year.  Yep, come March you';re going to see me there in Daytona Beach. And I';ll be wearing this Half Pink Flame Neoprene Face Mask. Because those 2.4 days of drinking, 2.5 miles of riding, and the 2.1 days of sleeping can get boring without my favorite neoprene face mask. Yeah, I know, I';ll figure out how to wear it while I';m sleeping. Shut up.  Anyway, this neoprene face mask is warm and water resistant. Seriously, have you ever been to Daytona Bike Week when it has not rained the whole time? And if I hook up with a random guy, the neoprene face mask is completely reversible to black so he won';t recognize me as I sneak out.  Yes sir, me and this 1/2 Pink Flame Neoprene Face Mask are going to take the Daytona by storm! I just need to find a good motorcycle and start learning how to ride.  Our 1/2 Pink Flame Neoprene Face Mask mask features half coverage of the face. Our stretchy neoprene material is warm and water resistant. The pattern is reversible to solid black material. Velcro closure ensures great fit with goggles, with a helmet or without. One size fits most.</g:description>

<g:title>Orange Flames Neodanna</g:title>
<g:description>They say that to keep a relationship working, you must kindle that spark. We can';t help with the Kindle, but here';s a Flame NeoDanna.  Just think. Just think! With a slightly better marketing department, the Flame NeoDanna might have been the NeoDanna that took the world by storm.  The Flame Neodanna is a revolutionary item with multiple features. Our 100% cotton bandanna is combined with a flame neoprene facemask to ensure full coverage of the face and neck, providing a comfortable light-weight fit. The neoprene section covers the cheeks, nose &amp;amp; mouth, while the bandanna is easily adjusted with a Velcro closure. Ideal for wind and dust protection in both warm and cold weather settings.  The Flame NeoDanna may not have the name, but it';s certainly got the goods. It';s just too bad it wasn';t sitting at the cool kids table back in the day. It really could have been somebody.</g:description>

<g:description>Please, someone call the fire department! My NeoDanna has burst into flames! Oh, the humanity! I can';t believe my new NeoDanna is gone!  What?  Yes, I did say flames. Why? And why aren';t you helping me put it out?  What do you mean, it';s impossible? That doesn';t make any sense! This is a NeoDanna! The Neodanna is a revolutionary item with multiple features.

<g:title>Glow Skull Ski Mask Balaclava</g:title>
<g:description>Ahhh. Can you feel it? The rush of the wind through your Grey Skull Balaclava. Invigorating! Lucky you. You're one of those people who can pull off a Grey Skull Balaclava. More things should be this cool, don't you think? Imagine how impressed your friends would be if you rolled up with any of the following:  Topless wombat Retractable merkin Interchanging meat hammers Modded CPAP machine Adjustable belly button Transforming oboe  Far more impressive than the convertible PT Cruiser you drove for that stint back in '05. Let's just say, it doesn't always pay to be an early adopter. Yes. We made fun of you. A lot. But look who's having the last laugh now! Go you!</g:description>

<g:description>Celebrate the "Luck O' The Irish" this St. Patty's day with this Green Skull Ski Mask Balaclava You know, all that "luck" the Irish people have experienced over the last several centuries&amp;hellip;  Listen, Ireland may have experienced its fair share of setbacks since it was invaded by the Normans in the 11th Century, such as brutal oppression by the early English kings, bloody and ongoing religious strife, the Great Potato Famine, a genetic predisposition to alcoholism among its citizens, a mass emigration in the 1840s, and U2, but at least they have &amp;hellip; hmmm &amp;hellip;  What has gone well for the Irish? Maybe that's why we celebrate the Luck O' The Irish once a year -- in the hopes that one of these times we'll manage to reverse their fortunes.</g:description>

<g:title>Infantry Ski Mask Balaclava</g:title>
<g:description>Infantry Balaclavais great for under the helmet ware. Printed with Killing in mind, with the high detail covering 360 degrees of the balaclava.  We can custom print your own design (please contact us for more information).   Whether it is a full face motorbike crash helmet or a mountain bike helmet, these masks will keep you warm and keep the dust out without getting wet through breathing.  Covering the full face and a long neck with a flange at the bottom of the neck so it can be tucked into your top - or left over, ensures that no dust or other objects will affect your breathing (and let';s face it, there's nothing worse than riding with a mouth full of flies or a nose blocked by dust)  Using the unique BLCOOL fabric, which has a 7 times higher "wicking" affect than cotton so it draws the moisture away from the skin to the outer layer where it can be easily evaporated. So, what is BLCOOL?  BLCOOL is a unique system to keep you cool and dry despite how hot you get. BLCOOL has 2 layers, the inside layer is a soft loose knit polyester fiber to absorb the sweat and to aid air flow over the skin. The outside layer has vertical slits to act as a siphon for the sweat allowing it to evaporate quickly with the heat of the body. This causes airflow into the fabric so cooling the skin. In short, BLCOOL acts the same as your skin does; it uses your own sweat to cool you down!</g:description>

<g:title>Always Ready Diamond Plate Print Ski Mask Balaclava</g:title>
<g:description>Our Always Ready Balaclavafits great under your Ski helmet. It is printed with high detail covering 360 degrees of the balaclava.  We can custom print your own design (please contact us for more information).   Whether it is a full face motorbike crash helmet or a mountain bike helmet, these masks will keep you warm and keep the dust out without getting wet through breathing.  Covering the full face and a long neck with a flange at the bottom of the neck so it can be tucked into your top - or left over, ensures that no dust or other objects will affect your breathing (and let';s face it, there's nothing worse than riding with a mouth full of flies or a nose blocked by dust)  Using the unique BLCOOL fabric, which has a 7 times higher "wicking" affect than cotton so it draws the moisture away from the skin to the outer layer where it can be easily evaporated. So, what is BLCOOL?  BLCOOL is a unique system to keep you cool and dry despite how hot you get. BLCOOL has 2 layers, the inside layer is a soft loose knit polyester fiber to absorb the sweat and to aid air flow over the skin. The outside layer has vertical slits to act as a siphon for the sweat allowing it to evaporate quickly with the heat of the body. This causes airflow into the fabric so cooling the skin. In short, BLCOOL acts the same as your skin does; it uses your own sweat to cool you down!</g:description>

<g:title>Blood Splatter Ski Mask</g:title>
<g:description>Our new Blood Splatter Ski Mask is great for the next Dexter Marathon that you watch.Here is something that we learned from watching Dexter: Blood behaves in much the same way as those spilled water droplets. A low-velocity spatter is usually the result of dripping blood. The force of impact is five feet per second or less, and the size of the droplets is somewhere between four and eight millimeters (0.16 to 0.31 inches). This type of blood spatter often occurs after a victim initially sustains an injury, not during the infliction of the injury itself. For example, if the victim is stabbed and then walks around bleeding, the resulting drops are a type of low-velocity spatters known as passive spatters. Low-velocity spatters can also result from pools of blood around the body of a victim and transfers (impressions left by weapons, or smears and trails left by movement). It can occur with some injuries, such as bleeding sustained from a punch.</g:description>

<g:title>Meaterian Balaclava</g:title>
<g:description>Our Meaterian Balaclavafits great under your motorcycle helmet. It is printed with high detail covering 360 degrees of the balaclava.  We can custom print your own design (please contact us for more information).  Whether it is a full face motorbike crash helmet or a mountain bike helmet, these masks will keep you warm and keep the dust out without getting wet through breathing.  Covering the full face and a long neck with a flange at the bottom of the neck so it can be tucked into your top - or left over, ensures that no dust or other objects will affect your breathing (and let';s face it, there's nothing worse than riding with a mouth full of flies or a nose blocked by dust)  Using the unique BLCOOL fabric, which has a 7 times higher "wicking" affect than cotton so it draws the moisture away from the skin to the outer layer where it can be easily evaporated. So, what is BLCOOL?  BLCOOL is a unique system to keep you cool and dry despite how hot you get. BLCOOL has 2 layers, the inside layer is a soft loose knit polyester fiber to absorb the sweat and to aid air flow over the skin. The outside layer has vertical slits to act as a siphon for the sweat allowing it to evaporate quickly with the heat of the body. This causes airflow into the fabric so cooling the skin. In short, BLCOOL acts the same as your skin does; it uses your own sweat to cool you down!</g:description>

Its bound nylon edges offers added comfort and durability, while the hook and loop closure ensures a great fit. Reversible to another cool design material, one size fits most. Slayer Ski Mask. Material: 70% Neoprene, 30% Polyester Slayer is a Chinese made neoprene Ski mask that is named after an American thrash metal band from Huntington Park, California, formed in 1981 by guitarists Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King. Slayer rose to fame with its 1986 release Reign in Blood, and is credited as one of the "big four" thrash metal bands, along with Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax. Between 1991 and 2013, the band sold 4.9 million albums in the United States. Slayer's musical style involves fast tremolo picking, double bass drumming, riffs in irregular scales and shouted vocals. In the original line-up, King, Hanneman, and lead vocalist/bassist Tom Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and most of the band's music was written by King and Hanneman, with additional help from Araya and drummer Dave Lombardo. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as serial killers, necrophilia, Satanism, religion, anti-religion, Nazism, and warfare, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits, and criticism from religious groups and the public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually, and lyrically. Since its debut album in 1983, the band has released eleven studio albums, two live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received five Grammy nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song Eyes of the Insane, and one in 2008 for the song "Final Six" (both from 2006's Christ Illusion). Slayer has also played at several music festivals worldwide, including Unholy Alliance, Download and Ozzfest.</g:description>

<g:title>Darth Vader Ski Mask</g:title>
<g:description>A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far away Naboo was under an attack And I thought me and Qui-Gon Jinn Could talk the Federation in To maybe cutting them a little slack  But their response, it didn't thrill us They locked the doors and tried to kill us We escaped from that gas Then met Jar Jar and Boss Nass  We took a bongo from the scene And we went to Theed to see the Queen We all wound up on Tatooine That's where we found this boy  Oh my my, this here Anakin guy Maybe Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry He left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye Sayin', "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi, soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"  Did you know this junkyard slave Isn't even old enough to shave But he can use the Force, they say  Ahh, do you see him hitting on the Queen? Though he's just nine and she's fourteen Yeah, he's probably gonna marry her someday  Well, I know he built C-3PO And I've heard how fast his pod can go And we were broke, it's true So we made a wager or two  Ooh, he was a prepubescent flyin' ace And the minute Jabba started off that race Well, I knew who would win first place Oh yes, it was our boy  We started singin', my my, this here Anakin guy May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye Sayin', "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi, soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"  Now we finally got to Coruscant The Jedi Council we knew would want To see how good the boy could be  So we took him there and we told the tale How his midi-chlorians were off the scale And he might fulfill that prophecy  Oh, the Council was impressed, of course Could he bring balance, to the force? They interviewed the kid, all training, they forbid  Because Yoda sensed in him much fear And Qui-Gon said, "Now listen here Just stick it in your pointy ear, I still will teach this boy"  He was singin'," My my, this here Anakin guy May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry" And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye Sayin', "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi, soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"  We caught a ride back to Naboo 'Cause Queen Amidala wanted to I frankly would've liked to stay  We all fought in that epic war And it wasn't long at all before Little hotshot flew his plane and saved the day  And in the end some Gunguns died Some ships blew up and some pilots fried A lot of folks were croakin' The battle droids were broken  And the Jedi I admire most Met up with Darth Maul and now he's toast Well, I'm still here and he's a ghost I guess I'll train this boy  And I was singin', my my, this here Anakin guy May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye Sayin', "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi, soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"  We were singin', "My my, this here Anakin guy May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry" And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye Sayin', "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi  We don't get to say this much, but the Darth Vader Ski Mask is MADE IN THE USA.

<g:title>Hard Full Skull Face Mask</g:title>
<g:description>If you haven't smelled Baghdad in the heat of summer then consider yourself lucky, my friend.  Upon moving(shipping) back to Baghdad, a good friend of Iron Horse Helmets once said, "I forgot just how much this city smells like hot garbage. Which is a lot. It smells like hot garbage a lot."  Now for those of you who have never been to Baghdad, imagine that smell, during the hottest part of summer, mingling with the aroma of over 7 million sweaty humans packed together like sardines. Big, gross, sweaty, stinking sardines.  And that, my friends, is why face masks like these were invented.  You think Samira Shahbandar could have landed Mr. Sadam if she reeked of rotting food and confrontation? No way. And have you seen her?   This mask is sure to make any Iraqi Women look a lot better.</g:description>

<g:title>Trickster Ski Face Mask</g:title>
<g:description>It's a minor refresh, but a refresh nonetheless. If you'll recall, we saw the original Joker Ski Face Mask in that Batman Movie, and now that we're 3.5 years in the future, the Trickster Ski Face Mask is making its debut for those who crave "clowning" around. Judging from the interior, little has changed from then until now, but the revamped exterior may be of interest -- there's a lot of lipstick on this mask...kind of like Courtney Love.  Ski face mask features full coverage of the face and ears. Stretchy Ski material is warm and water resistant. Lined with black stretch nylon trim. Patterns are reversible to solid black material. Velcro closure ensures great fit with goggles, with a helmet or without. One size fits most. Trickster Design.  These face masks are commonly used for motorcycle riding, bicycling in rough terrain, Courtney Love concerts, airsoft guns, paintball, skiing, hunting, and winter apparel.</g:description>

<g:title>Mexican Wrestling  Mask</g:title>
<g:description>ThisRey Mysterio wrestling mask will not keep you warm and it will not keep you dry. It is really not good for much, but it is fun as hell to wear. I have been wearing mine all day and I think it has become part of my life.   I am not quite sure I will be able to carry on once I take off this mask. It has really.....Really helped my love life.  Women walk up to me and whisper some romantic words to me in Spanish all the time. I am not sure what they are saying, since I don't speak Spanish, but I have started watching Dora so I should be fluent in Spanish real soon.     </g:description>

<g:title>Miss Pig Face Ski Face Mask</g:title>
<g:description>Well, I was a little worried about getting my son a Hog Ski Face Mask, but it all seems to have worked out just fine. I admit it, as a concerned parent, I knew all the horrible things you can find out there with a Ski face mask. And I know how a teenage boy thinks, so I was nervous! How could I monitor him when he could easily put the biker mask on a rob a bank. So it's great that, instead of using the warm, waterproof Ski mask for some nefarious purpose, he's instead using it to ride his motorcycle. Just a quick review of the convenient store surveillance system showed him walking in without the mask on. It's pretty clear! He sure is a good kid.          </g:description>

<g:title>Devil Ski Face Mask</g:title>
<g:description>I was skeptical at first...can this Ski face mask really glow in the dark? Turns out that it can. But it also has some other great benefits:  1. Every single person I have had an issue with is now afraid of me. It's not that quiet respect kind of thing either, these people are petrified of me. My neighbors used to get mad when the dog "Wally" would use their yard as a bathroom -- not any more. In fact, they don't get mad when I do it either.  2. The fact that it is reversible to solid black material is great. I wore it robbing a bank the other day, I reversed it and the cops had no idea it was me. They were looking for someone in a spiderweb face mask but I was now in what appeared to be a black face mask.  3. The vent Holes at Ear and Mouth is a must have. After all, breathing is pretty cool.  Just one negative:  1. Now that my wife has kicked me out of the house and I'm living on my motorcycle, I have really noticed the need for more ventilation. I haven't showered in six months and my Devil Ski Face Mask is pretty ripe smelling.  All in all I would buy this Devil Ski Face Mask again, and definitely recommend it to my friends (that live in a different state than I do).</g:description>

<g:title>Gas Mask Ski Face Mask</g:title>
<g:description>This is my Gas Mask Ski Face Mask. There are many like it, but this one is mine.  My Gas Mask Ski Face Masks is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.  My Gas Mask Ski Face Mask, without me, is useless. Without my Gas Mask Ski Face Mask, I am useless. I must breath true. I must stay warmer than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must wear my Gas Mask Ski Face Mask. I will...  My Gas Mask Ski Face Mask and myself know that what counts on a motorcycle is not the size of our engine, the noise of our pipes, or the smoke we make. We know that it is the Ski face mask that count.  My rifle is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel. I will keep my rifle clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...  Before God, I swear this creed. My Gas Mask Ski Face Mask and myself are the defenders of my country. We are the masters of our motorcycle. We are the saviors of my life. So be it, until victory is America's and there is no enemy, but peace!</g:description>

<g:title>Phantom Ski Face Mask</g:title>
<g:description>Were you naked on the six train screaming racial slurs and wearing only a Phantom Ski Facemask?   I was holding a cell phone and filming every moment of your beautiful insanity. For a moment I was sure you locked eyes with me (albeit crazy eyes). Before removing the final shred of your clothing for me and unveiling your beautiful body, you asked me to "get off this train" with you at Five Point Avenue. I did, but the cops carted you away before I had a chance to say anything.   Now I'M crazy thinking about you. I love how body confident you are and I wish I'd said something sooner. Get in touch, I could pay your bail and we could talk equality politics and get naked on any train you want. Maybe you could even turn me on to your acid dealer.   You will get 1 Capsmith Black &amp;amp; White Road Phantom (Scream Look) Design (SFARPH). This pattern reminds me of Scream Movie Face. Made from Ski it is one size fits most with velcro on back for size adjustment. Skulskinz Ski Face Masks are made by Capsmith, Inc. These are great for all climate conditions and Motorcycling, Hunting, Snowmobiling, Snowboarding, Sking, Paintball and many other sports and uses. Vent Holes for ears and mouth and mask is reversible to black. Elastic Ski protects face from water, sand, debris, wind, bugs and extreme hot and cold climates. Can be used with goggles under helmet or without helmet.</g:description>

<g:title>Devil Ski Half Face Mask</g:title>
<g:description>I've been waiting years to get my revenge on Tim Stratton, the guy who watched my parakeet drown. Now I'm one step closer.  Most people would probably just sue the guy, or beat him up, or move on and get a new parakeet. Any bird that can't even fly out of the water must be a pretty crappy bird. But that would be letting him off easy. No, my path to vengeance runs right through this Lethal Threat Half Devil Ski Face Mask.  You see, Tim is now a Born Again Christian. He is not the same sadistic S.O.B. how laughed at me after the death of my beloved. What do Born Agains fear? The Devil. The good fellas at Leather Threat must have had me in mind when the created this 2011 &amp;frac12; Devil Ski Facemask because there is nothing scarier than this mask.  Now I'll hire a detective, find out where Tim lives, contact the Pastor at his church, anonymously send him front-row tickets, and put the spotlight on him while I preach a sermon about his role in my parakeet's drowning. Then he'll get fired from his job and have to move away to a new town under an assumed name while I ride off on my motorcycle wearing my Lethal Threat Half Devil Ski Face Mask. People will talk about it for years.  Oh, I guess I should get started writing that Sermon, too. I'm thinking I'll call it "Hey, You're That Jerk Who Let My Parakeet Drown."</g:description>

<g:title>2 Faces Ski Face Mask</g:title>
<g:description>My name';s James Jockish. I';m a private detective. A slightly racist and sexist private detective. But I';ve been in counseling. I';m trying. The dame walked into my office. I took one look at those stems and almost forgot that the proper term was &amp;ldquo;young woman." We';d covered that just last week in sensitivity training. But it hadn';t stuck yet. I nodded as she sat down, taking a good look at the2 Faces Ski Face Mask she was wearing. &amp;ldquo;Mr. Jockisch,"; she began. &amp;ldquo;I need to hire you."; I studied her facemask. My first guess was that she was Oriental. But then I looked at the little card my therapist had given me. According to the card, oriental was what people called their rugs. This meant she was Asian. I didn';t know what kind of Asian but I knew we were going to talk about how to handle that in two weeks so I didn';t let it get to me. Therapy takes time. &amp;ldquo;What for, babycakes?"; The young woman didn';t react to that, so I guessed I was in the clear. Even still, the words warmed me up like a Ski Biker Mask. Is that how people felt around me? Was I really hurting people through my actions and beliefs? It was like a dam had broken and all these new feelings were rushing in. That time I punched a black guy in a country bar. When I stole that burrito from an Italian. Was I breaking stereotypes&amp;hellip; or just upholding them? I was just a guy, a guy like any other. And maybe I had made mistakes. But I could make amends. Beginning right now. &amp;ldquo;Ma';am, I apologize,"; I said before she could answer. &amp;ldquo;I shouldn';t have called you babycakes. I can tell by that2 Faces Ski Face Maskyou';re a classy dame&amp;hellip; I mean, young woman. And I';m gonna say&amp;hellip; Korean?"; She shook her head no, but she didn';t leave in horror like that Chinese waitress at the rib joint last week. Our eyes met. She took off her biker Facemask and slid it across the table towards me. I reached for it. Our fingertips met. And I decided that maybe this multicultural thing was okay after all. It was just too bad I';d have to get rid of my racist rug. Blue Ski skull facemasks feature full coverage of the face and ears. Stretchy Ski material is warm and water resistant. Blue Skull Patterns are reversible to solid black material. Velcro closure ensures great fit with goggles, with a helmet or without. One size fits most.</g:description>

<g:title>Muzzle Ski Face Mask</g:title>

She needs to mind her Ps and Qs,"; a source tells Iron Horse Helmet. &amp;lsquo;She';s saying shocking things for attention, but those things will follow her around and be reprinted forever.';"; &amp;ldquo;I wish someone had pulled me aside when I was young and told me that,"; Angie added. &amp;ldquo;Now I';ll forever be known as a lesbian or a self-cutter, instead of what I worked so hard to become. You have to put a muzzle on it! That';s right, or a muzzle Ski face mask so I don';t have to see her anymore.";  Ski muzzle face mask features full coverage of the face and ears. Ski material stretches and is warm and water resistant. Muzzle patterns are reversible to solid black material. Velcro closure ensures great fit with goggles, with a helmet or without.

<g:title>Thug Life Ski Face Mask</g:title>
<g:description>We dedicate the Thug life Ski Face Mask to our man Tupac Shakur. 2Pac lives! In fact, I saw 2pac drinking Hand Grenades in New Orleans wearing this Thug life Ski Face Mask. I thought it was odd to see a man wearing this Ski face mask on Bourbon Street while singing "Picture Me Rolling."  I walked up and asked the man if he was Tupac and he said yes. I was unable to get any sort of DNA evidence -- but his word is good enough for me.  This Thug Life Ski face mask features full coverage of the face and ears. The stretchy Ski material is warm and water resistant. The Thug Life pattern is reversible to solid black material. Velcro closure ensures great fit with goggles, with a helmet or without.

<g:title>Dark Rose Ski Face Mask</g:title>
<g:description>Staying at the trendy Tribeca Grand lent itself to the best fashion watching from models to downtown hipsters. Walking down the sidewalk one day I was caught behind a carefree group of FIT students dressed in every fall trend and evoking a sense of self that I wish everyone could be comfortable with. They had their own personal style that captured the essence of fall without spending a fortune. If you are looking to really get into fashion just walk down the streets of New York and see what the people that inspire trends are wearing.   1. Dark Rose Ski Face Masks - Water resistant and Reversible to solid black material.   2. Black Ski Face Mask - Althougth I suspect it was really just the Dark Rose Ski Face Mask reversed.   3. Biker Jewelry - I am sure they bought it from Iron Horse Helmets in Alabama.   4. Motorcycle Sunglasses - The Colorado design was splended.</g:description>

Many young children do not know, but Colonel James Braddock is an American officer who spent seven years in a North Vietnamese POW camp, then escaped 10 years ago.  After the bloodiest war, Braddock accompanies a government investigation team that goes to Ho Chi Minh City to check out reports of Americans still held prisoner.  Braddock gets the evidence then travels to Thailand, where he meets Tuck, an old Army buddy turned black market kingpin.  Together, they launch a mission deep into the jungle to free the American POWs from General Trau.</g:description>

But c'mon, let's not overlook the creepy feature here: It's a face mask. Think about it: People wear masks to do bad horrible things!!  Sure, it'll keep you warmer, but is that really worth promoting such self-destructive behavior?  Sure, it'll help people see you on your motorcycle, but is that really worth promoting such self-destructive behavior?   Ski material is wind and water resistant Works great under a helmet, goggles or alone Hook and loop closure is adjustable One size fits most Reversible to solid black side  </g:description>

<g:title>Zombie Ski Half Face Mask</g:title>
<g:description>Personally, I';m a little disappointed that this ZombieSki Face Mask is tastefully not vicious enough. You don';t copy a design from the world';s most ironic t-shirt only to half-ass the execution. Imagine if you bought this ZombieBiker Mask the right way. How great would it be&amp;mdash;when you finally manage to lure that hipster girl home from the biker bar&amp;mdash;to peel off your actual ZombieSki Face Mask and reveal you look like a Zombieunderneath?She would positively swoon. I mean, after all, she went home with a guy wearing a ZombieSki facemask. The roofies had to kick in at some point.ZombieDesign Ski facemask features full coverage of the face and ears. Stretchy Ski material is warm and water resistant. Black Bear Patterns are reversible to solid black material. Velcro closure ensures great fit with goggles, with a helmet or without. One size fits most.</g:description>

<g:title>Rebel Flag Ski Face Mask</g:title>
<g:description>People frequently react to tattoos with &amp;ldquo;what is that going to look like when you';re old and saggy?!"; In fact, that line of reasoning was my mom';s weapon of choice against any given ill-conceived teenage desire. &amp;ldquo;You want a tattoo? What will it look like when you';re old and saggy?"; &amp;ldquo;You want a navel piercing? What will it look like when you';re old and saggy?"; &amp;ldquo;You want to major in Peace and Conflict Studies? WHAT WILL THAT LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU';RE OLD AND SAGGY?!!";  Anyway, this time I listened. Instead of spending $300 on a Rebel Flag Tattoo, I just spent $10 on this Rebel Flag Ski Face Mask. The colors on this biker facemask won';t fade like the colors on a tattoo. Also, no one can see your rebel tattoo at 20 feet, but everyone can see your Rebel Flag Face Mask at 20 yards.  Rebel Flag Ski facemask features full coverage of the face and ears. Stretchy Ski material is warm and water resistant. Rebel Patterns are reversible to solid black material. Velcro closure ensures great fit with goggles, with a helmet or without. One size fits most.</g:description>

<g:title>Skull Wings Ski Half Face Mask</g:title>
<g:description>One day a Norwegian man named Wa Too Big walked into the office wearing Dress Pant and an Executive smock, but he felt like something was missing. After adjusting their eyes from the blinding whiteness of his exposed torso, the rest of the staff noticed something was missing too.   Then it hit him. The Up North Coast Workwear collection needed a Winged Skull half Ski Face Mask. Not just any Ski mask, but something that would be professional and stylish for the office, and also fit in a weekend rotation.  After some tinkering, Mr. Big developed the Winged Skull half Ski Face Mask, a dress mask that features soft-brushed Ski and not so colorful skull.   Ski material is wind and water resistant Works great under a helmet, goggles or alone Hook and loop closure is adjustable One size fits most Reversible to solid black side  </g:description>

<g:title>Silver Hard Skull Face Mask</g:title>
<g:description>If you haven't smelled Baghdad in the heat of summer then consider yourself lucky, my friend.  Upon moving(shipping) back to Baghdad, a good friend of Iron Horse Helmets once said, "I forgot just how much this city smells like hot garbage. Which is a lot. It smells like hot garbage a lot."  Now for those of you who have never been to Baghdad, imagine that smell, during the hottest part of summer, mingling with the aroma of over 7 million sweaty humans packed together like sardines. Big, gross, sweaty, stinking sardines.  And that, my friends, is why face masks like these were invented.  You think Samira Shahbandar could have landed Mr. Sadam if she reeked of rotting food and confrontation? No way. And have you seen her?   This mask is sure to make any Iraqi Women look a lot better.</g:description>

<g:title>Punk Rivet Black Leather Half Face Mask</g:title>
<g:description>It's too late now, and it's probably been too late for a decade. Daft Punk, the French electronic duo who has dominated the press for the last month, will be wearing their robot suits for the rest of their lives. There will never be a reveal, a coming out, or a change of tone. Frat-trance superstar Deadmau5 has, for the most part, removed the cybernetic mouse head. KISS wrote Lick It Up and took off the face paint on MTV. But even now, when Homework is a 16-year-old album, Daft Punk will always be a gold helmet and a silver helmet.  If Daft Punk wanted to, they could've removed their uniforms in the early 2000s without much fanfare or drama. They could've still headlined festivals, and toured with a giant pyramid, and they could still have made the gleaming, romantic dance music they've become famous for. But that didn't happen, and the cover of the just-released Random Access Memories is emblazoned with the same severe iconography. It's hard to think of any outfit in music that's stayed so relentlessly dedicated to a theme over multiple decades. GWAR? Maybe The Residents?  Daft Punk's aesthetic legacy is born out of its retro-futuristic novelty, and perhaps they keep the suits on to maintain their reputation. But that only goes so far. Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo are almost 40, and have been hiding their public appearance for a long time. The last 12 years have solidified Daft Punk as a band of robots. For every show, every commercial, every photo shoot, these two men have dressed up in what look to be sweaty, uncomfortable outfits. That is a profound dedication, and it can't be written off as simple frivolity. Why do they make this sacrifice? Clearly Daft Punk feel they benefit from the robots, and that might make them the most self-conscious band in the world.  It seems innocuous enough, but what would be the impact of a human face behind a song like "Get Lucky"? Would it feel the same? Or would it be just a little less intoxicating? Is it easier to fall for something pulpy and populist like roller-rink disco when it comes to us from cartoon characters? And as real-life humans, is it ever hard not to blush while making this music? Daft Punk's only resistance to the goof is their masks. The anonymous robots soak up all the attention and enthusiasm, and critics and fans alike start to regard Daft Punk on their own terms, in their own universe. Essentially, Daft Punk wipe away any qualms of plasticity by engaging in maximum goof. Saying "One More Time" is too silly misses the point, but without the masks, that criticism might become easier to make. Without the masks, Daft Punk might be a hated band.  Daft Punk rely on their costumes because they rely on suspended cynicism, so much so that they might fear ever breaking the fantasy. Superhero music needs to be made by superheroes, not mere mortals. It's not to say that Daft Punk haven't created some of the most singular dance music of their generation, but instead that the public's continued, unfettered enthusiasm about their music is directly tied to their image. Nobody can ever cut Daft Punk down for being too bright or too obvious&amp;mdash;what else would you expect from a pair of robots? There's no doubt the world wouldn't be as excited about Random Access Memories if it were coming from a pair of regular guys.  But you know what? The robots are totally worth it. If we need a giddy fantasy to trust ourselves enough to enjoy recklessly optimistic music, then they're doing God's work. Daft Punk needed to transcend their humanity for their confidence, for their message, and for their audience. They needed to create some distance from the world, in order to bring us in closer than ever. Their albums wouldn't be as magical if they were coming from planet Earth. Daft Punk dress up like robots for plenty of commercial reasons, but most of all, they do it for us.</g:description>

<g:title>Art Balaclava</g:title>
<g:description>This Art Balaclavais great for under the helmet ware and great for art students who want to riot! This Art Balaclava hashigh detail covering 360 degees of the balaclava.  We can custom print your own design (please contact us for more information).  Whether it is a full face motorbike crash helmet or a mountain bike helmet, these masks will keep you warm and keep the dust out without getting wet through breathing.  Covering the full face and a long neck with a flange at the bottom of the neck so it can be tucked into your top - or left over, ensures that no dust or other objects will affect your breathing (and let';s face it, there's nothing worse than riding with a mouth full of flies or a nose blocked by dust)  Using the unique BLCOOL fabric, which has a 7 times higher "wicking" affect than cotton so it draws the moisture away from the skin to the outer layer where it can be easily evaporated.  So, what is BLCOOL?     BLCOOL is a unique system to keep you cool and dry despite how hot you get. BLCOOL has 2 layers, the inside layer is a soft loose knit polyester fiber to absorb the sweat and to aid air flow over the skin. The outside layer has vertical slits to act as a siphon for the sweat allowing it to evaporate quickly with the heat of the body. This causes airflow into the fabric so cooling the skin. In short, BLCOOL acts the same as your skin does; it uses your own sweat to cool you down!</g:description>

<g:title>Glow in the Dark, Venetian Half Ski Face Mask</g:title>
<g:description>The ZANheadgear&amp;reg; Ski Half Face Mask features full coverage of nose, chin, and cheeks with stretchy Ski material that's water resistant and provides warmth. Its bound nylon edges offers added comfort and durability, while the hook and loop closure ensures great fit. Reversible to black material, one size fits most. Glow in the Dark, Venetian design. Material: 70% Ski, 30% Polyester The idea for the Glow in the Dark, Venetian Half Ski Face Maskis timeless. You think Kitty Hawk in 1903 was Orville's first try? Lincoln's eight lost elections didn't make him pause? Crockett didn't feel alone in 1836? Kennedy didn't have options to avoid the 13 days in 1962? Maskthat aren't truly comfortable are Maskthat don't get worn again, ever.  We make the hard choice early.  They go on a shelf, then a back shelf, then a cardboard box somewhere (by your wife).  Be strong, continue the search.  This Venetian Half Ski Face Maskjust might be the ones. I do think we captured it, but you will have to be the judge.</g:description>

<g:title>Creep Clown Balaclava</g:title>
<g:description>I can't count how many times I have been called a Creep Clown. Hey Creep Clown, come here. Hey, nice mask. Oh, look how cute, that guy is a Creep Clown.  It has gotten to the point that I feel more connected to my Creep Clown Balaclava then I do in my God given face. I mean, my Creep Clown Balaclava attracts ladies galore, my real face can't attract any chicks. My Creep Clown Balaclava keeps me warm and is water resistant, unlike my skin. BLCOOL is a unique system to keep you cool and dry despite how hot you get. BLCOOL has 2 layers, the inside layer is a soft loose knit polyester fiber to absorb the sweat and to aid air flow over the skin. The outside layer has vertical slits to act as a siphon for the sweat allowing it to evaporate quickly with the heat of the body. This causes airflow into the fabric so cooling the skin. In short, BLCOOL acts the same as your skin does; it uses your own sweat to cool you down!</g:description>

<g:title>Eagle Balaclava</g:title>
<g:description>Ah, Spring.  When a Motorcycle rider with his Eagle Nylon Face Masks rides lazily through the plains. Spring brings with its many changes over the American Great Plains. Fields of wheat are green with the promise of future growth. Young buffalo frolic on their still-ungainly legs in rolling seas of grass. The wind carries the sound of baby chicks'; permanent chiming for satiety from airborne parents swiftly winging from tree to ground and back again in a never-ending search for food. And on the roads, a motorcycle rider rides with his Eagle Nylon Face Mask in the wind.  His majestic, hard eyes gaze on the denizens of the prairie and the circular dramas of life that play out therein. Grass grows and is eaten by elk. Elk grow bigger and stronger and are eventually run down by wolves, who in turn grow old and are taken down by the wear, tear, and harsh realities of life in nature. Their bodies will eventually return to the earth to feed new grass.  Beside it all, the rider smiles blankly behind his Eagle Nylon Face Masks. Who knows how many new years and harsh winters this sumptuous, normally-sessile being has languorously witnessed from the road. His motorcycle gently roaring down the road. He waits for the day when the Eagle Nylon Face Masks will call his name and he can join the circle of life, returning from whence he came.  The Full Eagle Nylon Face Mask features full coverage of the face and ears. Its Stretchy Nylon material is warm and water resistant. The Eagle Pattern is reversible to solid black material. Velcro closure ensures great fit with goggles, with a motorcycle helmet or without. One size fits most.</g:description>

<g:title>Alien Balaclava</g:title>
<g:description>Now that I've got This Alien Balaclava, I can finally start working on my wolf novel. Right after I do the dishes.  Ah. Alright then, the dishes are done, my hands are good and dry, and a I've got a brand new notebook sitting next to my favorite writing chair. This is it. This is where the magic happens. I'm finally going to put to paper that novel I just know I've got in me. Now then, I'll just put on this Alien Balaclava Well, crud, I left the computer on. I should probably turn that off so I don't get distracted.  There we go. Sure, I spent a little time checking all my Twitter and Facebook, but NOW I'm ready to do some serious writing. After all, who can write a truly organic novel a wolf man killing rock stars during the hair metal scene in Los Angeles circa 1985 on a computer, am I right? It's so cold and unrealistic. And the way the cursor keeps blinking at you again and again and AGAIN while you're trying to craft a plot? Who needs that kind of mockery? Better to do it by hand with a facemask on! That's how Kerouac would've done it if he weren't such a drunk, I bet.  Just look at how gorgeous this mask is! With it's BLCOOL material which is a unique system to keep you cool and dry despite how hot you get. BLCOOL has 2 layers, the inside layer is a soft loose knit polyester fiber to absorb the sweat and to aid air flow over the skin. The outside layer has vertical slits to act as a siphon for the sweat allowing it to evaporate quickly with the heat of the body. This causes airflow into the fabric so cooling the skin.  In short, BLCOOL acts the same as your skin does; it uses your own sweat to cool you down! which feels good on your face so that you can write about wolves for a good long HOLY CRAP, would you look at my shoes? I should really get some new laces and fix these up before I get started.</g:description>

<g:title>X-Ray Skull Balaclava</g:title>
<g:description>This X-Ray Skull Balaclavais great for under the helmet ware and great for shark week! This X-Ray Skull Balaclavahashigh detail covering 360 degrees of the balaclava. We can custom print your own design (please contact us for more information). Whether it is a full face motorbike crash helmet or a mountain bike helmet, these masks will keep you warm and keep the dust out without getting wet through breathing. Covering the full face and a long neck with a flange at the bottom of the neck so it can be tucked into your top - or left over, ensures that no dust or other objects will affect your breathing (and let';s face it, there's nothing worse than riding with a mouth full of flies or a nose blocked by dust.) Using the unique BLCOOL fabric, which has a 7 times higher "wicking" affect than cotton so it draws the moisture away from the skin to the outer layer where it can be easily evaporated. So, what is BLCOOL?  BLCOOL is a unique system to keep you cool and dry despite how hot you get. BLCOOL has 2 layers, the inside layer is a soft loose knit polyester fiber to absorb the sweat and to aid air flow over the skin. The outside layer has vertical slits to act as a siphon for the sweat allowing it to evaporate quickly with the heat of the body. This causes airflow into the fabric so cooling the skin. In short, BLCOOL acts the same as your skin does; it uses your own sweat to cool you down!</g:description>

<g:title>Skull Mask Balaclava</g:title>
<g:description> Joan of Arc, the peasant girl who helped lead resistance to the English in the Hundred Years'; War, is today the patron saint of France and a bona fide national heroine, depicted in countless statues, stamps, and oil paintings. She and Napoleon were France';s only representative time-travelers inBill and Ted';s Excellent Adventure, if that lets you know what a big deal she is. But depending on where (literally) you draw the line, Joan wasn';t from France at all&amp;mdash;the Gallic equivalent of finding out that Abraham Lincoln was a secret Canadian.   Joan (actually Jeanne) was born around 1412 in the village of Domr&amp;eacute;my, which is today in northeastern France. But in the 15th century, Domr&amp;eacute;my was part of the Duchy of Bar, a small independent territory that wasn';t annexed by France until 1766. The Duchy of Bar lay between France and the Holy Roman Empire, and a typically convoluted series of feudal alliances meant that the King of France might have had no sovereign claim on the land where Joan grew up, depending on the exact (and long disputed, by historians) course that a nearby brook happened to take past her house! Her neighbors certainly felt loyalty to the French crown in the Armagnac-Burgundian civil war going on at that time&amp;mdash;Joan said at trial that she knew only one Burgundian in Domremy, and she wished she could cut off his head. But she also spoke many times of traveling from her village &amp;ldquo;into France."; TheBarrois(residents of Bar) at the time clearly did not consider their province a part of France proper.   Just as with her birth, much of what you know about Joan of Arc';s death could probably use some debunking as well. When Joan was examined, she was found to be a virgin, and church law at the time insisted that women who consorted with the devil were literally, you know,consortingwith the devil. So she was never accused of witchcraft, only &amp;ldquo;heresy."; In May 1431, Joan renounced her heresy&amp;mdash;the divine voices she claimed to hear&amp;mdash;and agreed to switch to women';s clothes, which saved her from execution. But she was burned at the stake a week later because she had started wearing men';s clothing again, either because her dress had been stolen, or as a defense against rape (accounts differ). In the end, her capital crime was against fashion, not theology.  What does Joan have to do with out Skull Mask Balaclavaface mask? Not much, but there was no tooth past in 1431. She needed this mask just so you would not smell her breath.</g:description>
